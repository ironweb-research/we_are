## Remember ARPANET?
The U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first public packet-switched computer network. The early days of the internet, particularly ARPANET, involved universities like MIT, Stanford, and UCLA. It was centralized to ensure security, manageability, and controlled development. Limited resources and expertise meant a focused, centralized approach was necessary to build a reliable infrastructure before scaling it out. 

## Centralized Control Remained Unchanged 

The internet began as a _highly centralized entity_. In the early days, it was primarily controlled by a few institutions and organizations, most notably ARPANET, which was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense in the late **1960s**. This centralized control ensured rigorous standards and protocols but also limited widespread access and innovation.

**1980s**: Commercial entities started to recognize the potential of the internet. The creation of _Domain Name Systems_ (DNS) in 1983 and the _World Wide Web_ (WWW) in 1989 laid and harderned the foundation for broader use.

**1990s**: The internet began to open up to the public. The launch of web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator allowed users to navigate the web more easily. Companies like AOL and Yahoo! emerged, providing centralized portals for internet access. Social media started to make its mark toward the late '90s with platforms like Six Degrees and early blogging sites.

**2000s**: Social media truly took off with the advent of platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. Search engines like Google became dominant, centralizing the way people found information. Tech giants such as Amazon and eBay revolutionized e-commerce, bringing more centralized control to the online marketplace.

This centralization brought about significant advancements _but also raised concerns about privacy, security, and the monopolistic control of digital landscapes_.
